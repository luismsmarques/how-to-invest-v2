# learn-guide — Authoring beginner guides

Audience: **young beginners** with little or no finance background. Goal: make them feel investing is understandable and calm, never salesy. Output is for the `learn` CPT (archive `/learn/`), bilingual EN + PT (Polylang), and doubles as **ebook chapters**.

Read `CLAUDE.md` (invariants) and `docs/` before writing substantive content.

## Non-negotiable invariants (same as the whole project)
1. **Educational, never advice.** Conditional/illustrative language ("a profile like this often…", never "you should buy"). No imperative calls to act.
2. **By asset class only** — global equities, bonds, cash, REITs/alternatives, crypto. **Never** name instruments, tickers, funds, brokers or companies.
3. **Rules decide, content explains.** Any allocation shown must match the engine's curated archetype ranges; don't invent numbers. Crypto only ever a tiny, optional, conditional slice.
4. **Disclaimer** present (use the theme/engine disclaimer block, never a bespoke one).
5. **No execution CTAs** (no "open an account with X"). The only conversion CTA is the questionnaire and the newsletter/ebook.

## The learning path (the backbone)
Every guide is one chapter; the sequence is also the ebook's table of contents. Category = `learn_topic`.

- **Module 0 — Mindset & money** (`mindset`/`planning`): why invest · compound interest · emergency fund first · budgeting basics
- **Module 1 — Foundations** (`concepts`): what investing is · risk & reward · time horizon · inflation
- **Module 2 — Asset classes** (`concepts`): global equities · bonds · cash · REITs/alternatives · crypto (minimal slice)
- **Module 3 — Diversification & portfolios** (`concepts`): diversification · asset allocation · example portfolios by profile · rebalancing
- **Module 4 — In practice** (`getting-started`): account types · costs & fees · how a portfolio is built (generic) · periodic investing (DCA)
- **Module 5 — Behaviour** (`mindset`): staying calm in drops · common mistakes · scam/red-flag awareness
- **Module 6 — Your plan** (`getting-started`): set goals · take the questionnaire → archetype · next steps

Keep `learn_topic` to the existing four slugs: `getting-started`, `concepts`, `mindset`, `planning`.

## Structure of a guide
1. **H1** = the title (one only).
2. **Hook** (2–3 sentences): the beginner's question this answers, in plain words.
3. **"In one line"** summary box (TL;DR) up top.
4. **Body in short H2/H3 steps** — numbered when it's a process. One idea per section, short paragraphs, concrete everyday analogies.
5. **Key takeaways** bullet list near the end.
6. **Glossary + internal links**: link the first mention of any term to its glossary entry; link forward/back to the previous/next chapter; one contextual link to the questionnaire where natural.
7. **Disclaimer block** (standard).
8. **Excerpt** set (used by the hub list + meta description fallback).

Tone: warm, encouraging, jargon-free; define every term on first use; prefer "you" sparingly and never imperative about money decisions. Aim ~700–1200 words per chapter.

## Bilingual EN + PT
- Write **both** EN (default) and PT. PT is European Portuguese (pt-PT), informal "tu", same meaning not literal translation.
- Link the pair as Polylang translations; file each under the same `learn_topic` (PT term has the `-pt` slug — see `class-seeder.php`).

## SEO (primary business goal — see seo-wordpress skill)
- **Title** ≤ 60 chars, includes the beginner search term ("what is…", "how to…").
- **Meta description** ~150 chars, benefit-led.
- One H1, logical H2/H3 hierarchy; descriptive slug.
- Internal links to glossary + adjacent chapters (cluster around the path pillar).
- Schema is emitted automatically (`Article` via class-seo); ensure title/excerpt/thumbnail are set.

## How to create it
- New `learn` post (EN) + PT translation, set `learn_topic`, excerpt, featured image, then link translations.
- For repeatable seeding, extend `class-seeder.php` (`articles()` + `learn_category_of()`), keeping it idempotent — that's how existing chapters ship and stay re-runnable.
- A chapter authored here must be ebook-ready: self-contained, with the takeaways box (the `ebook-build` skill pulls title + body + takeaways).
